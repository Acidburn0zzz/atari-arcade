============
The Atari Arcade was among the most demanding projects because it required 
full multi-touch, multi-player support across modern browsers and devices.  
Most HTML5 games are available in isolation so the hardware and browser can 
be dedicated just to gameplay.  But that’s not how we envisioned a modern 
arcade – where users could gather, play the games, challenge their friends 
to high-score dominance, and earn achievements.  So we had to rethink how 
we approached game development with a common set of tools.
